Hello!

This repo is just my attempt at creating an OS from nothing but ~~some~~ lots of documentation.

Feel free to try and play aroud with it, but it's in an extremly alpha stage, so I recomend
trying it on an emulator.

Oh, and you may need an UNIX based OS to compile/launch it. Cause it's easier.

Ps : please post any bugs/new features you find/want/made! I'll soon improve the current libc and the current ls. Maybe the shell if I've the time.
