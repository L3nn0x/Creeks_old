Hello!

This repo is just my attempt at creating an OS from nothing but <b>some</b>lots of documentation.

Feel free to try and play aroud with it, but it's in an extremly alpha stage, so I recomend
trying it on an emulator.

Oh, and you may need an UNIX based OS to compile/launch it. Cause it's easier.
